# Game Day Shift Scheduler
Designed for the game day teams of colleges and universities to streamline the process of scheduling shifts, submitting shift trade requests, and more. Inspired by my time with Mohawk Mountaineers game day team.

## Supervisors
- Can schedule shifts through the portal
- Can accept/deny shift trade requests
- Can approve/deny hours worked for each team member

## Team Members
- Can see their past/upcoming shifts
- Can request to trade shifts with another team member
- Can record their actual hours worked for each shift

# Technologies In Use
- ASP.NET Core MVC & Web API
- MS SQL Server for handling identities
- MongoDB for storing shift data, etc.
- .NET MAUI for the mobile application
